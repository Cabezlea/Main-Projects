# Snake Game in Java

This project is a classic Snake game implemented in Java. It was developed to practice object-oriented programming concepts and game development in Java.

## How to Play

- **Start the Game**: Run the `Main.java` file.
- **Game Controls**:
  - Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right).
  - The objective is to eat as many food items as possible by navigating the snake to them.
  - Each food item consumed increases the length of the snake.
  - The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the game boundary.

## File Structure

- **Main.java**: The main class that sets up the game window and manages the game loop.
- **Board.java**: Handles the game board, including rendering and game logic.
- **Snake.java**: Contains the logic for the snake's movement and growth.
- **Food.java**: Manages the placement and properties of the food items.
